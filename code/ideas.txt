- Hexagonal template structure
- Parallelize mat multiplications (in parameter updates)
- Use gradient norm images (apply blur before)
- Incorporate bending energy variable (see Bookstein 89 TPS and Richa's code (naya TPS))
- Blur images before compensation
- What happens when a template has no neighbors? No combinations that contain it are created. Is it
  not adjusted? Wouldn't that detriment the final mosaic?
- Does the fact that there is rarely a direct path to the anchor have a significant impact on the
  final mosaic? See heat maps in CIARP paper, for example. There is a huge circle of templates that
  isn't even close to the center. That probably has something to do with the poor results.
- Some of the deformable mean images created during illumination compensation are really messed up.
  Affected areas seem to be filtered by the masks. Check to make sure.
- What happens to the estimated warp when a template has two neighbors? It should become all messed
  up, due to the template trying to move to two sides at the same time. Maybe this is the reason the
  resulting mosaic is completely deformed. The use of local regions for the adjustment should fix
  this.
- Split the image into regions and align them separately

- Ignore template pairs whose similarity is too low or whose overlap is too small.
- Add another parameter to the equation being minimized, representing the bending energy of the
  two templates: Σ(I(x) - T(x)) + λΣ(cI - cT)², where λ is a constant that regulates the weight of
  the new value and cI - cT is the distance between each respective control point in I and T.
  Separate x from y when measuring that distance to prevent a circular acceptable area between
  control points.
  - Another possible parameter would be a weight for each term of each pair's equation based on
    their NCC similarity.
- Find another illumination compensation method
